## <span>DISCLAIMER</span>

<span>I have "moved on" from developing to focus on school and my mental health. This site (and many others) won't be updated as often.</span>  
<span>If you really need to contact me find my email below. See the [Bluesky post](https://bsky.mcalec.dev/) I made about this.</span>  

<span>This site may not be fully complete, I suggest you to use [old.mcalec.dev](//old.mcalec.dev/) for any sort of updated information.</span>  

## <span>About Me</span>

<span>Hi, I see that you landed here on my website! So let me tell you about myself (if you care).</span>  
<span>I am a [Front-End Dev](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_frontenddev.asp) and a (somewhat of a) [Full-stack Dev](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp).</span>  
<span>I've created some small projects (i.e. this website) and created, now dead, Minecraft mods.</span>  
<span>I have many other web projects at my [GitHub Website](https://git.mcalec.dev/) and at my [Gitea Page](https://gitea.mcalec.dev/).</span>  

<span>Also I know alot of PowerShell and Batch scripting. Not sure why I like it, but go check it out on my GitHub (linked above).</span>  
<span>Some front-end languages I know are, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web frameworks wise I am planning to learn (soon).</span>  
<span>Now backend isn't my strongest background but I know my way around [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).</span>  

## <span>Read Me</span>

<span>I have a statement on my [GitLab README file](https://gitlab.com/mcalec-dev/mcalec.dev/blob/main/README.md) to clarify things about my projects.</span>
